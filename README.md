# Demos for Geometrically Continuous Splines
The codes in this repository implement the algorithm in our paper [An algebraic framework for gemetrically continuous splines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09096), which computes a basis for a G^r spline space using symbolic computation.

To run the codes, one may follow these steps:
* Download and install [Macaulay2](https://macaulay2.com/).
* Clone this repository on your computer.
* Run the file demos.m2 in Macaulay2.

Some computation results on bases are recorded [here](./Python_files). 
One may run those codes in Python to obtain some 3D interactive surfaces. 
We have some screenshots on the [author's webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/beihuiyuan/home/demos).
